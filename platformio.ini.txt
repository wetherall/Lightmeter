[env:ATtiny3217]
platform = atmelmegaavr
board = ATtiny3217
; framework = arduino  ; Removed for pure AVR C code

; Build flags
build_flags = 
    -Wall 
    -Os
    -DF_CPU=4000000UL        ; Set F_CPU to 4MHz
    -DCLOCK_SOURCE=0         ; Use internal oscillator
    -D__AVR_ATtiny3217__

; Upload configuration for UPDI Friend
upload_protocol = serialupdi
upload_speed = 115200

; Specify the UPDI Friend port
; On macOS, the UPDI Friend typically appears as one of these:
upload_port = /dev/cu.usbmodem*

; Additional configuration for UPDI programming with pyupdi
upload_flags = 
    -c
    $UPLOAD_PORT
    -b
    $UPLOAD_SPEED

; This helps with logging during upload
monitor_speed = 115200

; Board configuration to use 4MHz
board_build.f_cpu = 4000000L
