/**
 * Power Management Implementation
 * 
 * This file contains the implementation of power management functions
 * for the light meter device. Effective power management is crucial
 * for extending battery life in portable devices.
 * 
 * These functions control:
 * - Sleep modes (low power states)
 * - Wake-up behavior
 * - Battery monitoring
 * 
 * The device uses a TPS62203 switching regulator for efficient 3.3V power
 * from 3 LR44 batteries (approximately 4.5V input).
